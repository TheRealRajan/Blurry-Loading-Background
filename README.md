# Blurry-Loading-Background
A demonstration of a **loading screen** which shows the site loading-in using a blurred up image and a percentage value. As the percentage value increases, the blurriness of the image decreses until the blur value reaches zero and the image turns clear. And, simultaneously, the percentage value fades away as its opacity reaches zero. <br>
